```

### Running Locally

The app runs entirely in the browser with in-browser Babel compilation. Simply open `index.html` or serve it with any HTTP server.

**Without backend:**
- Sudoku generation works (client-side)
- Leaderboard and chat are disabled

**With backend:**
- All features enabled
- Requires Google Apps Script deployment

### API Health Check

```bash
# Set your GAS URL
export GAS_URL="https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_ID/exec"

# Run diagnostics
./diagnostic.sh
```

## 📝 Configuration

Configuration is managed through `config/config.local.js` (gitignored):

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
  GAS_URL: 'https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_SCRIPT_ID/exec',
};
```

See [Configuration Guide](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) for details.

## 🚢 Deployment

### Frontend (GitHub Pages)

1. Push `index.html` and `src/app.jsx` to your repository
2. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
3. Your site will be live at `https://[username].github.io/[repo]/`

### Backend (Google Apps Script)

1. Create a new Apps Script project at [script.google.com](https://script.google.com)
2. Copy code from `apps_script/Code.gs`
3. Deploy as Web App with "Anyone" access
4. Copy deployment URL to `config/config.local.js`

**Full deployment guide:** [DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md)

### Development Guidelines

- Keep changes minimal and focused
- Follow existing code style
- Test all changes locally
- Update documentation if needed
- Ensure no security vulnerabilities

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

- **404 on GAS requests**: Check deployment URL in `config/config.local.js`
- **CORS errors**: Ensure GAS deployment has "Anyone" access
- **Leaderboard not loading**: Verify Sheet ID in `Code.gs` matches your Google Sheet
- **Config not found warning**: Copy `config.example.js` to `config.local.js`

See [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for more solutions.

## 📊 API Reference

All endpoints use GET requests with an `action` parameter:

| Endpoint | Parameters | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| `ping` | none | Health check |
| `generateSudoku` | `difficulty` | Generate new puzzle |
| `getLeaderboard` | none | Get top scores |
| `saveScore` | `name`, `difficulty`, `time`, `date` | Save score |
| `getChat` | none | Get chat messages |
| `postChat` | `username`, `text`, `id` | Post message |
| `logError` | `type`, `message`, `userAgent` | Log error |

**Example:**
```javascript
const url = `${GAS_URL}?action=generateSudoku&difficulty=Easy`;
const response = await fetch(url);
const puzzle = await response.json();
```

## 🔒 Security

- Configuration files with sensitive data are gitignored
- No authentication required (public game)
- Input sanitization on backend
- XSS protection via proper escaping
- HTTPS-only communication

**Security considerations:**
- `config.local.js` is never committed (in `.gitignore`)
- GAS deployment URL can be public (it's just an API endpoint)
- No personal data is collected
- Chat messages are sanitized

# Sudoku Logic Lab

A modern, feature-rich Sudoku game with campaign mode, real-time chat, leaderboards, and optional user authentication.

## Features

### Core Gameplay
- 🎮 **Multiple Difficulty Levels**: Easy, Medium, Hard, and Daily challenges
- 🗺️ **Campaign Saga**: Story-driven campaign with progressive difficulty
- ⏱️ **Timer & Mistake Tracking**: Track your performance
- ✏️ **Notes Mode**: Pencil in possible numbers
- ↩️ **Undo System**: Correct mistakes easily
- 🎨 **Dark Mode**: Easy on the eyes

### Social & Competitive
- 🏆 **Global Leaderboard**: Compete with players worldwide
- 💬 **Real-time Chat**: Communicate with other players
- 👥 **Optional Authentication**: Track stats across devices

### User Modes

The game uses a **natural flow** authentication approach - users are only prompted to sign in when they want features that benefit from authentication:

#### 🎮 Guest Mode (Default)
- **Play immediately** - No sign-up required
- Progress saved locally in browser
- Full access to all game features
- Random username assigned (e.g., "Guest1234")
- **Natural prompts**: After winning or when using social features, you'll see contextual suggestions to create an account

#### 🔑 Login
- Sign in to existing account when prompted
- Access stats from any device
- Track wins, losses, and completion time
- Progress synced to cloud
- **Prompted when**: Winning games, using chat, viewing leaderboard

#### ✨ Register
- Create a new account when you're ready
- Username and password protected
- Stats tracked across devices
- Keep your campaign progress
- **Prompted naturally**: The game suggests registration at the right moments

**Key Philosophy**: Users are never forced to create an account! Authentication prompts appear contextually when features benefit from it, always with the option to continue as a guest.

## Quick Start

### For Players

1. **Visit the Game**: Go to the deployed GitHub Pages URL
2. **Choose Your Mode**:
   - Click "Continue as Guest" to play immediately
   - Or sign up/login for cloud sync
3. **Start Playing**: Choose Quick Play or Campaign Saga

### For Developers

See [docs/DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md) for detailed deployment instructions.

**Quick Deploy:**
1. Deploy Google Apps Script backend
2. Configure `config/config.local.js` with your GAS URL
3. Push to GitHub with Pages enabled
4. Done!

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: React 18 (in-browser Babel compilation), hosted on GitHub Pages
- **Backend**: Google Apps Script Web App (serverless)
- **Database**: Google Sheets (4 sheets: Leaderboard, Chat, Logs, Users)
- **Communication**: HTTP GET requests to GAS API endpoints

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed architecture documentation.

## Authentication System

The authentication system uses a **natural flow** approach:
- ✅ **Optional**: Users can always play as guests
- ✅ **Contextual**: Prompts appear when features benefit from auth (winning, chat, leaderboard)
- ✅ **Non-forceful**: Users can always choose to continue as guest
- ✅ **Simple**: Username + password (hashed)
- ✅ **Cloud-synced**: Stats tracked across devices
- ⚠️ **Demo-grade security**: Not suitable for sensitive data

**Natural Flow Triggers**:
- 🏆 After winning a game (suggests saving scores to cloud)
- 💬 When sending a chat message (establishes identity)
- 📊 When viewing leaderboard (suggests tracking progress)

**Important Security Note**: The current authentication uses a simple hash for demonstration purposes. For production use with sensitive data, implement proper authentication (Firebase, Auth0, OAuth, etc.). See [docs/AUTHENTICATION_SETUP.md](docs/AUTHENTICATION_SETUP.md) for details.

  - LocalStorage for guest mode

- **Backend**:
  - Google Apps Script (serverless)
  - Google Sheets (database)
  - RESTful API over HTTP GET

- **Hosting**:
  - GitHub Pages (frontend)
  - Google Cloud (backend via GAS)

## Development

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/edmund-alexander/Sudoku-Labs.git
   cd Sudoku-Labs
   
   # Configure Git to handle divergent branches
   git config pull.rebase false  # merge (default)
   ```
2. Create `config/config.local.js` (copy from `config/config.example.js`)
3. Start a local server:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```
4. Open http://localhost:8000

**Note**: Without a configured GAS backend, the app will:
- Generate puzzles locally (offline mode)
- Store scores in LocalStorage only
- Disable chat and authentication features
