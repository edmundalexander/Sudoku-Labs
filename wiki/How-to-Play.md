## Tips for Beginners

### 1. Start with Easy Numbers
Look for rows, columns, or boxes with many clues—they're easier to complete.

### 2. Use the Process of Elimination
If 8 numbers are already in a row, the missing one is obvious!

### 3. Look for Single Candidates
If only one number can go in a cell, fill it immediately.

### 4. Check Box-Row/Column Interactions
If a number must be in one row of a box, it can't be in that row elsewhere.

### 5. Take Breaks
Stuck? Step away for a few minutes. Fresh eyes help!

## Advanced Techniques

### Naked Pairs
If two cells in a row/column/box can only contain the same two numbers, eliminate those numbers from other cells.

### Hidden Pairs
If two numbers can only go in two cells in a row/column/box, those cells can't contain other numbers.

### X-Wing
If a number appears in only two positions in two rows, and those positions are in the same columns, eliminate that number from those columns.

### Swordfish
An advanced extension of X-Wing using three rows/columns.

### More Strategies
Practice these techniques in the game to improve your solving skills. The more you play, the better you'll get at recognizing patterns!

## Scoring System

### Time-Based Scoring
Your score is based on completion time:
- **Faster = Better**: Lower time = higher rank
- **Difficulty Matters**: Harder puzzles = separate leaderboards
- **Moves Don't Count**: Only time affects your score
- **Errors Don't Penalize**: But they slow you down!

### Leaderboard Ranking
Rankings are separate for each difficulty:
1. Easy Leaderboard
2. Medium Leaderboard
3. Hard Leaderboard
4. Daily Challenge Leaderboard
